if any trade is posted here , i will update here and mention you all ,

If sl smashed i will update ,
If tp smashed i woll update

Dont enter at random spot and cry like cuck

And dont mention me with questions like :

is the trade valid ? Because everything related to the trades im gonna post here and mention you here 

Stop acting like clowns and cucks ü´µüèªüòà | @Xvek Notif take tp1 at fet at 0.7696 | @Xvek Notif pepe and fet still active .
wont share any more trades in weekends till those 2 tp or sl | Move fet sl to be @Xvek Notif | @Xvek Notif move sl to be up 2% | @Xvek Notif gm everyone tp1 taken 2R here | so basically guys to become profitable following my trades or everyone trades , i will give you some stuffs to follow : 
1: never enter the trade above entry , if its up more than 0.5% , dont enter it .
2: never risk more than 2-5% of your port on sl smash , for example , if your port is 1000 , maximum amount you will lose if the stoploss hit is 50 dollars , you can adjust leverage and margin based on stoploss . 
3: if the trade have 2 entries , you enter 50% of your position size on first entry , and the other 50% on the 2nd entry , to have better risk to reward.
4: you can close 75% of your position on tp1 , or more or less , most of times is always better to secure profits .
5: since we have more than 8 traders in the discord , you need to check everyone channel , check their past preformence , and follow 2 traders at max , you follow all their trades , you dont dip on a trader after smashing 1 or 2 sl , because you will end up switching traders and picking everyone sl and fade their tps .
6: if you are happy with your profits , or over risked in the trade , make sure to adjust your position size so you dont end up getting liq.
7: the most important one , if you are using isolated , make sure to lower the leverage so your liquidation is lower than the sl , so you dont end up losing the trade before the stoploss hit

if any trade is posted here , i will update here and mention you all ,

If sl smashed i will update ,
If tp smashed i woll update

Dont enter at random spot and cry like cuck

And dont mention me with questions like :

is the trade valid ? Because everything related to the trades im gonna post here and mention you here 

Stop acting like clowns and cucks ü´µüèªüòà | @Xvek Notif take tp1 at fet at 0.7696 | @Xvek Notif pepe and fet still active .
wont share any more trades in weekends till those 2 tp or sl | Move fet sl to be @Xvek Notif | @Xvek Notif move sl to be up 2% | @Xvek Notif gm everyone tp1 taken 2R here | so basically guys to become profitable following my trades or everyone trades , i will give you some stuffs to follow : 
1: never enter the trade above entry , if its up more than 0.5% , dont enter it .
2: never risk more than 2-5% of your port on sl smash , for example , if your port is 1000 , maximum amount you will lose if the stoploss hit is 50 dollars , you can adjust leverage and margin based on stoploss . 
3: if the trade have 2 entries , you enter 50% of your position size on first entry , and the other 50% on the 2nd entry , to have better risk to reward.
4: you can close 75% of your position on tp1 , or more or less , most of times is always better to secure profits .
5: since we have more than 8 traders in the discord , you need to check everyone channel , check their past preformence , and follow 2 traders at max , you follow all their trades , you dont dip on a trader after smashing 1 or 2 sl , because you will end up switching traders and picking everyone sl and fade their tps .
6: if you are happy with your profits , or over risked in the trade , make sure to adjust your position size so you dont end up getting liq.
7: the most important one , if you are using isolated , make sure to lower the leverage so your liquidation is lower than the sl , so you dont end up losing the trade before the stoploss hit

if any trade is posted here , i will update here and mention you all ,

If sl smashed i will update ,
If tp smashed i woll update

Dont enter at random spot and cry like cuck

And dont mention me with questions like :

is the trade valid ? Because everything related to the trades im gonna post here and mention you here 

Stop acting like clowns and cucks ü´µüèªüòà | @Xvek Notif take tp1 at fet at 0.7696 | @Xvek Notif pepe and fet still active .
wont share any more trades in weekends till those 2 tp or sl | Move fet sl to be @Xvek Notif | @Xvek Notif move sl to be up 2% | @Xvek Notif gm everyone tp1 taken 2R here | so basically guys to become profitable following my trades or everyone trades , i will give you some stuffs to follow : 
1: never enter the trade above entry , if its up more than 0.5% , dont enter it .
2: never risk more than 2-5% of your port on sl smash , for example , if your port is 1000 , maximum amount you will lose if the stoploss hit is 50 dollars , you can adjust leverage and margin based on stoploss . 
3: if the trade have 2 entries , you enter 50% of your position size on first entry , and the other 50% on the 2nd entry , to have better risk to reward.
4: you can close 75% of your position on tp1 , or more or less , most of times is always better to secure profits .
5: since we have more than 8 traders in the discord , you need to check everyone channel , check their past preformence , and follow 2 traders at max , you follow all their trades , you dont dip on a trader after smashing 1 or 2 sl , because you will end up switching traders and picking everyone sl and fade their tps .
6: if you are happy with your profits , or over risked in the trade , make sure to adjust your position size so you dont end up getting liq.
7: the most important one , if you are using isolated , make sure to lower the leverage so your liquidation is lower than the sl , so you dont end up losing the trade before the stoploss hit

If sl smashed i will update ,
If tp smashed i woll update

Dont enter at random spot and cry like cuck

And dont mention me with questions like :

is the trade valid ? Because everything related to the trades im gonna post here and mention you here 

Stop acting like clowns and cucks ü´µüèªüòà | @Xvek Notif take tp1 at fet at 0.7696 | @Xvek Notif pepe and fet still active .
wont share any more trades in weekends till those 2 tp or sl | Move fet sl to be @Xvek Notif | @Xvek Notif move sl to be up 2% | @Xvek Notif gm everyone tp1 taken 2R here | so basically guys to become profitable following my trades or everyone trades , i will give you some stuffs to follow : 
1: never enter the trade above entry , if its up more than 0.5% , dont enter it .
2: never risk more than 2-5% of your port on sl smash , for example , if your port is 1000 , maximum amount you will lose if the stoploss hit is 50 dollars , you can adjust leverage and margin based on stoploss . 
3: if the trade have 2 entries , you enter 50% of your position size on first entry , and the other 50% on the 2nd entry , to have better risk to reward.
4: you can close 75% of your position on tp1 , or more or less , most of times is always better to secure profits .
5: since we have more than 8 traders in the discord , you need to check everyone channel , check their past preformence , and follow 2 traders at max , you follow all their trades , you dont dip on a trader after smashing 1 or 2 sl , because you will end up switching traders and picking everyone sl and fade their tps .
6: if you are happy with your profits , or over risked in the trade , make sure to adjust your position size so you dont end up getting liq.
7: the most important one , if you are using isolated , make sure to lower the leverage so your liquidation is lower than the sl , so you dont end up losing the trade before the stoploss hit

If sl smashed i will update ,
If tp smashed i woll update

Dont enter at random spot and cry like cuck

And dont mention me with questions like :

is the trade valid ? Because everything related to the trades im gonna post here and mention you here 

Stop acting like clowns and cucks ü´µüèªüòà | @Xvek Notif take tp1 at fet at 0.7696 | @Xvek Notif pepe and fet still active .
wont share any more trades in weekends till those 2 tp or sl | Move fet sl to be @Xvek Notif | @Xvek Notif move sl to be up 2% | @Xvek Notif gm everyone tp1 taken 2R here | so basically guys to become profitable following my trades or everyone trades , i will give you some stuffs to follow : 
1: never enter the trade above entry , if its up more than 0.5% , dont enter it .
2: never risk more than 2-5% of your port on sl smash , for example , if your port is 1000 , maximum amount you will lose if the stoploss hit is 50 dollars , you can adjust leverage and margin based on stoploss . 
3: if the trade have 2 entries , you enter 50% of your position size on first entry , and the other 50% on the 2nd entry , to have better risk to reward.
4: you can close 75% of your position on tp1 , or more or less , most of times is always better to secure profits .
5: since we have more than 8 traders in the discord , you need to check everyone channel , check their past preformence , and follow 2 traders at max , you follow all their trades , you dont dip on a trader after smashing 1 or 2 sl , because you will end up switching traders and picking everyone sl and fade their tps .
6: if you are happy with your profits , or over risked in the trade , make sure to adjust your position size so you dont end up getting liq.
7: the most important one , if you are using isolated , make sure to lower the leverage so your liquidation is lower than the sl , so you dont end up losing the trade before the stoploss hit

FARTCOIN,LONG,1.3753,1.467,1.31944,"Its very simple really
Its all about your risk tolerance
If your port is 1k and you risk 500 and you dont care about it
You are good to go
And if your port is 1k and u risk 20 and still stressed about it you should risk less
Its about you at the end
Because when you are stressed about a trade you close before tp and dca in red
So you end up ruining ur acc | And from now on all trades gonna be 1 tp , if you close before , your issue | I change my position size to 200k
So it works as magnet
